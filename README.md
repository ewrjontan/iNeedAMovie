# I Need A Movie

## Description

This is my first React application created for my Nucamp class. 
The app utilizes API Dojo's IMDB API to fetch movie titles; either a random title or one based on a user's genres of interest.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
